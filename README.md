Strategic lending analysis using Excel &amp; Power Query to reduce portfolio default rates through advanced borrower segmentation.
The Professional README Structure
Here is the exact layout you should follow, including the specific headings and what goes inside them:

1. Project Title & Executive Summary
#Heading: # Strategic Credit Risk Analysis: Optimizing LendingClub Portfolio Returns

Content: A 3-sentence summary. State the problem (defaults), your action (segmentation), and the result (reduced risk).

Why: Recruiters need to know the "value" immediately.

2. Business Problem Statement
##Heading: ## The Challenge: Reducing Default-Related Capital Erosion

Content: Explain that in banking, a 1% decrease in the default rate can mean millions in saved capital. State that your goal is to find the "tipping point" where a borrower becomes too risky.

3. Data Architecture & Governance
##Heading: ## Data Pipeline & Governance

Content: Mention the source (Kaggle) and your .gitignore strategy.

Instruction: TAKE A SCREENSHOT of your organized folder structure (01_Raw, 02_Workbooks) and put it here.

Why: This proves you are organized and understand data security.

4. Methodology (The "ETL" Process)
##Heading: ## Technical Methodology: ETL & Data Transformation

Content: Use bullet points to describe using Power Query.

Step 1: Filtered for completed loan cycles (Fully Paid vs. Charged Off).

Step 2: Feature Engineering (e.g., creating the Debt-to-Income bins).

Instruction: TAKE A SCREENSHOT of your "Applied Steps" in Power Query and place it here.

5. Analysis & Key Insights
##Heading: ## Risk Segmentation & Financial Insights

Content: This is the "meat" of the project.

Insight 1: The correlation between FICO scores and default rates.

Insight 2: The impact of DTI (Debt-to-Income) on repayment success.

Instruction: TAKE A SCREENSHOT of your most impactful Pivot Table or Chart. Use "Conditional Formatting" (Red/Green) to make it look professional.

6. Final Recommendations (The "Senior" Part)
##Heading: ## Strategic Recommendations

Content: Tell the "bank" what to do.

"Restrict lending to Grade D borrowers with DTI > 35%."

"Adjust interest rates for low-income segments to cover the 5% higher default variance."

##Professional Formatting Tips
Use Markdown: Use # for the main title and ## for sections.

Bold Key Terms: Bold words like Default Rate, Risk Mitigation, and Power Query.

Use Visuals: Never have more than two paragraphs of text without a screenshot or a bulleted list.
